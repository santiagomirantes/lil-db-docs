# How to contribute to lil-db.js
The best way to contribute to lil-db is to report any bug or issue that you found and (if you want) make a push request or point out a possible solution.
## How to report a bug
To report a bug go into the [**Issues**](https://github.com/santiagomirantes/lil-db-docs/issues) section of the repository
## Syntax of an issue
Please whenever you want to report a bug or issue follow this structure so it can be easily understandable:

 - **Issue:** describe the problem.
 - **Where did you find it:** give a sample of the code you executed to know where did the issue happen.
 - **Consequences:** describe the implications of the issue (for e.g. if the operation you wanted to make was still executed right or not).

Please remember that i´m just one person behind this proyect so it might take a while for each issue to be correctly solved. All code contributions and suggestions for further improvement of the library are welcome!
